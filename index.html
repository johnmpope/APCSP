        <p> I am a senior here and my 3rd year in the Piedmont school district. Millennium high has been a great place and I have found many great people to interact with. I also do great with my academics and have submitted my applications for college and am starting to hear back from some. </p>

        <p>This is Interstellar, one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a really compelling story about an astronaut who has to sacrifice himself to save the world. We follow him as he explores the universe looking for a new planet for the human race to live.</p>
